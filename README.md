  ## Description

  I started this project by using the initial html and css code from the clone of my forked page from gitlab. I then made a repository on github for this assignment and uploaded the existing files there. Once I had the repository made correctly, including the link that contains the direct web address for the html file, I started to work the javascript.
  The first thing I made was an array of all the characters that my password was going to use. After those were all listed out then I started work on my first function which, starts off prompting the user for how many characters they would like to make the password within the set length parameters. Alerts were used to let the user know if they went outside the defined parameters. Once a password length was chosen, the user could confirm whether or not they wanted the different types of characters avalible. If for some reason the user did not chose any character types then and alert was set so that they would know that one type would have to be chosen. The types of characters chosen was then stored in an array and the inital function was complete. 
  The second function used all the parameters chosen from the previous function to determine where it was going to pull characters from and put enough of those characters into a new array so that it would match the length required. Once this new array had all the amounts and types of characters in it, it was passed through a loop so that they characters would all be random. After the random characters for each type was chosen, they were joined together into one string and the password was placed into a variable. The variable was then set to equal the section of the webpage document that was a text location that the html had denoted as where the password would be placed. 
  Commits were made a several intervals thoughout the process when one portion of the code had been successfully completed. All the changes were pushed to github and along with this readme file. Please see the below for an image of the password generator.
